# Maze-Solver-Robotics-8051
I built a robot that can find its way out from a maze of puzzling lines. The robot moves through the maze arena using infra-red optical sensors. When it detects a junction, the bot intelligently decides the path using a special algorithm. The programming logic is fed into the robot's brain (microcontroller 8051) so that it can zip through to the end point.
